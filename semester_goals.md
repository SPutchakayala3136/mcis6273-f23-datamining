What do you wish to accomplish this semester in Data Mining?

**Main Agenda:**
My Main Agenda is to get a clear understanding of Data Mining concepts. Mainly core concepts like
  •	Classification
  •	Association
  •	Data Mining Algorithms
  •	Analysis procedures
  •	Programming language like Python
  •	Outlier detection
  •	Clustering
  •	Regression
  •	Prediction
Here, I will mention my experience in Data Mining.
**Previous Experience:**
I have done this Data Mining course in my bachelor's degree, so I have little bit knowledge on some concepts like:
_**1.	Supervised Learning :**_
Classification
_**2.	Unsupervised Learning:**_
Clustering
