**What is your reaction to the podcast? Pick at least one point brought up in the interview that you agree with and list your reason why?**
Ans 2:

The podcast is a great resource for beginning a career in data science and is very motivating. The one thing that really got my attention was how she learnt Python and got started without having any prior experience of IT-related subjects. Coming from a background in physicology, she developed a route in data science, and taking part in these types of podcasts is particularly beneficial for aspiring students and learners who are interested in beginning a career in data science. It is essential that multiple teams work closely with the data scientist team during the development process for better and more effective delivery.

**After listening to the podcast, do you think you are more informed about the importance of Python to Data Science? How?(Bebriefâ€“one sentence will suffice.)**
Ans 3:

Yes, now I know how important to learn python before kick starting the journey as a Data Scientist. Python has rapidly expanded in popularity among data scientists, and new libraries have elevated it to a top position.

**List one surprising fact you learned from listening to this podcast.**
Ans 4:

How "Pandas" is important for data analysis. How libraries' documentation aids in reducing the amount of time developers must spend troubleshooting their programmes. use Matplotlib to visualise data. How you developed your search engine and put it into use.
